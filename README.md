# 🗒️ [ECE2112] Programming Assignment #4: Data Wrangling and Data Visualization

#### **Data Wrangling**
> It is the process by which the data required by an application is identified, extracted, cleaned, and integrated, to yield a dataset that is suitable for exploration and analysis.

#### **Data Visualization**
> The visual representation of a domain space using graphics, images, animated sequences, and sound augmentation to present the data, structure, and dynamic behavior of large, complex datasets that represent systems, events, processes, objects, and concepts.

## 📖 I. Intended Learning Outcomes:
1. To identify the codes and functions needed in cleaning and visualizing data.
2. To be able to apply and use the different codes and functions in creating a Python program that will be used in data wrangling and data visualization.

## ✒️ II. Instructions
>[!Important]
> Download the ECE Board Exam 2 dataset found on this link: [board2.xlsx](board2.xlsx)

Write a Python script/code in the Jupyter Notebook to solve the given problems. You may submit your Jupyter notebook in the dedicated submission bin.

### **ECE BOARD EXAM PROBLEM:**
> Using data wrangling and data visualization techniques with storytelling, analyze the data and present different (i) data frames; and (ii) visuals using the dataset given.

---

### **Problem 1:** Data Wrangling
Create the following data frames based on the format provided:  
> **_Example:_** Vis = [“Name”, “Gender”, “Track”, “Math<70”]; hometown is constant as Visayas  
> <em>**Output:**</em>  
> ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a598587-dbec-4ddd-8eb8-84f8f9cee6ee)  

a. Filename: Instru = [“Name”, “GEAS”, “Electronics >70”]; where track is constant as Instrumentation and hometown Luzon  
b. Filename: Mindy = [“Name”, “Track”, “Electronics”, “Average >=55”]; where hometown is constant as Mindanao and gender Female  

---

### **Problem 2:** Data Visualization
Create a visualization that shows how the different features contribute to the average grade. Does the chosen track in college, gender, or hometown contribute to a higher average score?  
a. By Track  
b. By Gender  
c. By Hometown
